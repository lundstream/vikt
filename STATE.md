# STATE.md

Updated at the end of every session. Keep it short and current, this is not a
changelog.

Per CLAUDE.md §7, the current-state section describes only what was **exercised
through the interface**. Work that exists as API only is listed under **API
without a screen** until a screen calls it.

---

## What this is

A self-hosted weight and habit tracker. One person's instance, invite-only, with
a public landing page that can be turned off. The reasoning behind every
non-obvious choice is in `DECISIONS.md`, which is the document to read before
changing anything architectural.

## Current state

**The app is something a stranger could be handed.** It says what it stores and
why, asks before storing it, lets somebody leave with everything, tells people
when it will be down, and its mail goes out.

- **Phases 0 to 6 are built and used daily**: invite-only auth, the weight log
  and trend line, adaptive TDEE and projections, the food database with barcode
  scanning and meal templates, measurements and the daily log, milestones and
  the savings pot, and the PWA with its offline queue.
- **Logging works offline** and syncs on reconnect. A local store that opens and
  will not accept a row falls through to sending directly, and says so (D118).
- **Mail is delivered** by a drainer inside the API process, and every link in
  every message is absolute and checked to be reachable (D104, D109, D113).
- **`/integritet` and `/villkor`** are real pages, and the contact address on
  them is a deployment setting rather than a constant in the source (D106,
  D121).
- **Consent is explicit and dated**, and an account can be deleted by the person
  who owns it (D107).
- **Administration** is eight tabs covering every admin endpoint, reachable only
  by an admin, with every action written to an audit log (D95, D100).
- **The theme is a choice** of system, dark or light, stored per account (D117),
  and the app offers to install itself where the platform allows (D116).

### API without a screen

Empty.

### What is not done

- **Photos** (§6 phase 7) and the self-service deletion hook that waits on them.
- **The local LLM layer** (§6 phase 8) and the coach (8b).
- **Group features** (§6 phase 9) and **device integrations** (§6 phase 10).
- **SMB and S3 backup destinations**, named in the settings and refused with a
  reason.
- **Habits and reminders, MFA, and importing from other apps** — phases 11 to 13,
  written down in CLAUDE.md §6 and not started.

## Verified

**1215 tests**: 464 shared, 184 web, 567 api. Lint clean, all three packages
typecheck, both bundles build, and the placeholder guard passes.

Measurements, and the conditions they were taken under, are in
`docs/measurements.md`. The landing page's tap figures are pinned to that file
by a test, so a fast path that changes without the page changing fails the
suite.

## Known gotchas carried into this project

The long list lives at the bottom of `DECISIONS.md` where each one has its
reasoning. The three that catch people most often:

- **`useTestApp` registers Vitest hooks, so it must run at file level.** Calling
  it inside a test registers hooks that never run.
- **Secure-context APIs do not exist over http on a LAN IP.** Three times now:
  `crypto.randomUUID`, the camera, and `BarcodeDetector`. See
  `docs/secure-context.md`.
- **Measuring page-load performance on the dev server measures the dev server.**
